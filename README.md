# Final Project by Lucia Delgado and Jessica Jiang

### Project Description:
The goal of this visualization is to generate a tool that contributes to increase awareness of the risk of obesity, to promote healthy habits among the Mexican population, and eventually come up with more effective way to tackle this epidemic.

The interactive dashboard combines a set of visualizations: BMI by Age and Gender, Sugar Sweetened Beverages, and Interactive Map. We focused on deliver information in a truthful, comprehensive, and functional way while making the visualizations appealing and easy to interpret to users. The dashboard is designed to be easy to navigate so it increases the chance that users will engage in exploring more information included in the dashboard.
