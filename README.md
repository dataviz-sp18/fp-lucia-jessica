# Final Project by Lucia Delgado and Jessica Jiang

Project Description:

Our goal is to generate a tool that contributes to increase awareness of the risk of developing obesity and to promote healthy habits among the Mexican population. We expect to do so by providing information about the prevalence of this problem in Mexico. 

To achieve our goal, we developed an interactive dashboard that combines a set of visualizations with the information we want to share with the user. We allow the user to understand if she is at risk of developing obesity by computing her BMI index. We also provide information about the prevalence of habits that impact the risk of developing obesity. Finally, we explore perceptions among the Mexican population about the consumption of SSBs, since this is one of the main drivers of obesity in the country.

Through the development of our visualizations, we focused on making the visualizations appealing to the user and easy to interpret. We also focused on making the dashboard easy to navigate, since this will increase the chances that the user will get engaged in exploring the information included in the dashboard.
